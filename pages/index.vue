      the demon Krishna in the form of a horse. Early Hindu cultures \
      believed in horse sacrifices. The viewpoint is straight on, and \
      it's almost like a 2d painting extended into 3d space. ",

      Sculpted panels are seen with carved figurines of river goddesses \

      and destroyer of the universe and conveys the Indian conception of \
      the never-ending cycle of time. You can see in the shape of the arms, \
      they make a circular structure and this has meaning. His top right \
      hand has the drum of the creation of the world. The upper left hand \
      holds the fire that will destroy the universe. His lower hands cup \
      his troubled soul.",
